Broadcast Moodle events to pre-registered webhooks
------------------------------------------

This has been designed for use with Zapier but could be used in other situations too.
It has been tested on Moodle 3.1 but should probably work in Moodle 2.7 or greater.

Installation
--------------
Download,unzip,rename Or git clone the plugin folder "trigger" into the [path/to/moodle]/local folder.


Usage
--------------
On the settings page for the plugin enter eventname and webhook (url) pairs.
e.g
trigger: \core\event\user_enrolment_deleted
webhook: https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/1020304/v9plzv/

If the 5 slots are too few, you can add more by increasing the trigger count setting on the same page.

After changing any of the settings on the settings page, you will need to:
i) visit your site's notifications page to make sure the new setting does not need to be "installed." If so, just let Moodle do that for you.
ii) "purge all caches" for any changes to be reflected. Do that at: 
  site admin->debugging->purge all caches
